In the quiet, early morning light, Mrs. Jenkins hobbled down the cobblestone street, her eyes peeled for any sign of trouble. She was a small, stout woman, her gray hair pulled into a tight bun, and her expression etched with the lines of a thousand worries. Her gnarled hands clutched the handle of her shopping cart, which squeaked in protest with every step she took. The neighborhood was still mostly asleep, the only sounds the distant bark of a lonely dog and the occasional car passing by. Mrs. Jenkins had always been an early riser, but today felt different. There was a chill in the air that seemed to whisper secrets she wasn't meant to hear.

Her eyes fell on a young boy sitting on the stoop of a house, hugging his knees to his chest. He couldn't have been more than ten, with a mop of unruly hair and clothes that looked two sizes too big. He was shivering in the cool spring air, and Mrs. Jenkins felt a pang of pity. She slowed her pace, the wheels of her cart grinding to a halt beside him. "You okay, dear?" she asked, her voice kind but firm.
