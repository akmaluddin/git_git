In the quiet town of Almhult's Bend, there lived a peculiar man named Peter. He was a solitary soul, known mostly for his meticulous garden and his daily strolls with a battered old hat perched on his head. His house was a peculiar shade of blue, standing out like a sore thumb amidst the sea of white picket fences. The townspeople often exchanged curious glances when they saw him, but no one ever approached to ask why he painted it that way. Peter tended to his garden with a gentle touch, his face etched with lines of concentration as he coaxed life from the earth. His days were a silent pattern of digging, planting, and pruning.
