# Getting changes in

Collaborative works means we need to take changes from others

You should be a bit familiar with `git pull`

> [!TIP]
> Sometimes your branch and the remote may have diverged
> Then you might need to perform a fast forward with either rebase or merge strategy

Your colleague has made some modifications on another branch and while you were working on your branch you needed to pull them in
