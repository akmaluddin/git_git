Welcome to git intro workshop. First things first fork this repository so that you could maintain your own remote :)

We will cover the basics of using git with some contrived but practical use cases

Forking is an example of a git task, however not necessarily something you will bump into in your day-to-day tasks

Half of your workflow as a developer will just be 4 simple commands:

- git status
- git add
- git commit
- git switch

We will cover the use cases above as swiftly as possible as you should be familiar with it

Once you have managed to fork the repo, take some time to familiarise what your working directory is and once you are comfortable we can start with the first example:-

> [!NOTE]
> The excercises live in their own branch
> You should be able to switch to any of these branches by simply running
>
> ```bash
> git switch 01-branching
> ```
>
> or the old way
>
> ```bash
> git checkout 01-branching
> ```
