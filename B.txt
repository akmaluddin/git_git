One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the town in a soft, orange glow, Alfred noticed a small, unassuming bird with a broken wing, struggling to fly. He felt a strange kinship with this creature, an outsider like him. His heart swelled with empathy, and he knew he had to help. He carefully picked up the bird and took it into his house, setting it on the kitchen table. The room was cluttered with various odds and ends, but he managed to clear a space and get a closer look. The bird's feathers were a mix of dull browns and grays, but there was a hint of something more beneath the grimeâ€”a spark of color that reminded Alfred of a long-forgotten memory.
