One morning, as Alfred sat with Marigold, a young girl named Lily from down the street knocked tentatively on the door. She held a bouquet of flowers, her eyes brimming with excitement. Alfred had always been polite, but his heart had been closed off to others since his wife's death. Yet, as he looked into Lily's hopeful gaze, he felt a part of himself stir that he had thought long dormant. He invited her in, and she shyly offered the flowers, her voice trembling. "For Marigold," she said, her voice barely a whisper. Alfred took the bouquet, his eyes glistening with unshed tears, and placed it in the bird's cage.
